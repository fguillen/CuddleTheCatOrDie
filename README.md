# Cuddle the Cat ... or Die

The city is full of Cats, they need your cuddle... or they will scream

## Description

​The cats of this city have a very powerful scream. You have short time to find them and cuddle them before they start screaming

It is very inspired in the old 80s game: Prohibition

The prototype of this game was made in 8 hours for the [BerlinMiniJam](http://berlinminijam.de/) of December 2020.
